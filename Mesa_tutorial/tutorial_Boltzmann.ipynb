The `do` function and Python functionality can be configured to activate agents in different orders. This can be important as the order in which agents are activated can impact the results of the model [Comer2014]. At each step of the model, one or more of the agents -- usually all of them -- are activated and take their own step, changing internally and/or interacting with one another or the environment.\n",

        "**Model-specific information:** For this section we will randomly reorder the Agent activation order using  `mesa.Agent.shuffle_do` and have the agents `step` function print the agent's unique id that they were assigned during the agent creation process.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Code implementation:** Using standard ABM convention we add a `step` function to the `MoneyModel` class which calls the `mesa.Agent.shuffle_do` function.

However, one of the advantages of agent-based models is that we can often watch them run step by step, potentially spotting unexpected patterns, behaviors or bugs, or developing new intuitions, hypotheses, or insights. Other times, watching a model run can explain it to an unfamiliar audience better than static explanations. Like many ABM frameworks, Mesa allows you to create an interactive visualization of the model. In this section we'll walk through creating a visualization using built-in components, and (for advanced users) how to create a new visualization element.\n",

The visualization is done in a browser window, using the [Solara](https://solara.dev/) framework, a pure Python, React-style web framework. Running `solara run app.py` will launch a web server, which runs the model, and displays model detail at each step via the Matplotlib plotting library. Alternatively, you can execute everything inside a notebook environment and display it inline."
